# CoffeeScript Starter Kit

This starter kit for CoffeeScript development enables you to get started immediately and not spend precious time on configuring your environment. Just follow the simple steps below and start coding!

## Installation

First of all, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) needs to be installed. Using npm, install both [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) globally:

```
npm install -g gulp bower
```

Now the local packages needs to be installed; run the following:

```
npm install && bower install
```

## Usage

Now that the development environment is installed, using it is as simple as running gulp:

```
gulp
```

Gulp will now watch for changes to your files and automatically compile and minify your code and update your browser for you.
